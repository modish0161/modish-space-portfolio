# Real Estate Tokenization Smart Contract

The Real Estate Tokenization smart contract facilitates the tokenization of real estate properties, enabling fractional ownership and trading of property shares on the Ethereum blockchain. This contract provides a decentralized platform for creating property tokens, transferring shares, and managing ownership securely.

## Features

- **Property Token Creation:** Allows property owners to tokenize real estate assets by creating property tokens with specified details such as name and total shares.
- **Share Transfer:** Enables the transfer of property shares between addresses, facilitating fractional ownership transfers and trading.
- **Share Ownership Tracking:** Tracks the number of shares owned by each address for a property token, ensuring transparent ownership management.
- **Event Emission:** Emits events for property creation and share transfers, providing visibility into contract activities for external systems.
