# Mining and Quarrying Contract

## Overview

The "MiningAndQuarryingContract" is a blockchain-based solution designed to enhance transparency, efficiency, and trust within the mining and quarrying industry. Utilizing Ethereum smart contracts, this platform provides a secure and immutable framework for managing mineral batches, land rights, royalties, and compliance audits. By leveraging the unique capabilities of ERC721 tokens, zk-SNARKs technology for privacy, and role-based access controls, the contract aims to modernize industry practices related to mineral extraction and land management.

## Features

### Mineral Batch Registration and Tokenization

- Each mineral batch is uniquely identified and tokenized as an ERC721 token, ensuring traceability from extraction to sale.
- Detailed information about each mineral batch, including type, quantity, source, and extraction date, is securely stored and linked to a land right ID for ownership verification.

### Land Right Management

- Land rights are registered on the blockchain with details about ownership, location, and size, providing a transparent record of mining entitlements.
- Landowners can be directly compensated through automated royalty payments based on predefined rates and actual mineral extraction volumes.

### Dynamic Royalty Payments

- A dynamic royalty system calculates and distributes royalties automatically, ensuring fair compensation for landowners based on real extraction quantities.
- Royalty rates are adjustable and linked to specific land rights, allowing for flexible and equitable financial arrangements.

### zk-SNARKs Integration for Privacy (Planned)

- The contract plans to integrate zk-SNARKs technology to enable privacy-preserving verification of mineral batches and land rights, enhancing data security while maintaining transparency.

### Audit Trail and Compliance

- An audit trail feature allows for the registration of compliance audits, providing immutable records of environmental and regulatory adherence.
- Audits detail compliance status and are linked to specific mineral batches or land rights, supporting industry accountability and sustainability efforts.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- The contract implements RBAC to define and enforce roles for different actions, such as registering mineral batches, managing land rights, setting royalty rates, and conducting audits, ensuring that only authorized parties can perform sensitive operations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ethereum wallet with ETH for deployment and transactions.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm (Node Package Manager) installed.
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle) or [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) for compiling and deploying the contract.
- Access to an Ethereum testnet or mainnet.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Compile the contract:

   ```
   truffle compile
   ```

   or

   ```
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

4. Deploy the contract to your chosen network:

   ```
   truffle migrate --network <network_name>
   ```

   or

   ```
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network_name>
   ```

### Usage

- Interact with the deployed contract through Truffle, Hardhat, or a custom frontend interface to register mineral batches, land rights, and perform other contract functions.

## Security

This contract has been carefully designed with security, privacy, and scalability in mind. However, as with any smart contract, it is crucial to conduct thorough testing and auditing before deploying to the Ethereum mainnet. Review the code, utilize testnets, and consider engaging professional auditing services to ensure the contract's integrity and security.
