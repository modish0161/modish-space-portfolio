# Product Lifecycle and Authenticity Contract

## Overview

The "Product Lifecycle and Authenticity" smart contract leverages the power of Ethereum blockchain and ERC-721 tokens to track the lifecycle of products from creation to recycling, ensuring their authenticity and sustainability. This contract is designed for businesses and consumers who prioritize transparency, environmental responsibility, and product authenticity in their operations and purchasing decisions.

## Key Features

- **ERC-721 Tokenization**: Each product is represented as a unique ERC-721 token, allowing for secure tracking and verification of ownership and product history.
- **Dynamic Metadata**: Product details, including certifications and lifecycle information, are stored off-chain and linked via metadata URIs, ensuring rich data availability.
- **Recycling Tracking**: Products can be marked as recycled, promoting sustainability and enabling a circular economy within the ecosystem.
- **zk-SNARKs Integration**: Planned integration with zk-SNARKs technology will allow for privacy-preserving verification of product authenticity without revealing sensitive data.
- **Decentralized Identity (DID)**: Incorporates DIDs for advanced product identification, further enhancing security and verifiability.
- **Environmental Impact Tracking**: Captures and records the carbon footprint and sustainability sourcing of products, emphasizing environmental consciousness.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- An Ethereum wallet with ETH for transactions.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm installed.
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle) or [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) for compiling and deploying the contract.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ProductLifecycleAndAuthenticity
```

2. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Compile the Contract**

```bash
truffle compile
# or
npx hardhat compile
```

### Deployment

Deploy the contract to your chosen Ethereum network:

```bash
truffle migrate --network <network_name>
# or
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network_name>
```

## Usage

1. **Register a Product**

```bash
function registerProduct(string memory name, string memory metadataURI) public onlyOwner
```

- Call this function to mint a new ERC-721 token representing a product, specifying its name and metadata URI.

2. **Mark a Product as Recycled**

```bash
function recycleProduct(uint256 productId) public
```

- Product owners can mark their products as recycled, contributing to sustainability efforts.

3. **Update Product Metadata**

```bash
function updateProductMetadata(uint256 productId, string memory newMetadataURI) public
```

- Allows product owners to update the metadata URI, reflecting changes in product information or lifecycle status.

4. **Verify Product Authenticity (Planned)**

- Integration with zk-SNARKs will enable privacy-preserving verification of authenticity.

## Security

This contract prioritizes security and privacy. However, as with any smart contract, thorough testing and potentially a professional security audit are recommended before deployment to the Ethereum mainnet.
