# AgriProductTraceabilityAndAgreement

## Overview

The "AgriProductTraceabilityAndAgreement" smart contract is designed for the agricultural sector to enable secure, transparent, and efficient traceability and management of agricultural products and agreements. Leveraging Ethereum blockchain technology, this contract facilitates the tokenization of agricultural products, the establishment of agreements between farmers and distributors, and the execution of escrow payments, ensuring the delivery of products before payment release. The contract aims to bring trust and clarity to agricultural transactions, reducing disputes and improving supply chain visibility.

## Features

### Product Registration and Tokenization

- Allows for the registration of agricultural products as unique ERC721 tokens, each with specific attributes such as name, category, and metadata URI pointing to detailed product information.
- Enables traceability of products from farm to consumer, enhancing transparency and trust in the agricultural supply chain.

### Agreement Management

- Facilitates the creation of agreements between farmers and distributors, specifying details such as product ID, quantity, and price, directly within the blockchain.
- Secures transactions through an integrated escrow mechanism that ensures payment is only released upon product delivery confirmation.

### Escrow Payments

- Incorporates an escrow system to manage and secure payments between parties, automatically releasing funds upon confirmation of product delivery by the distributor.

### Dispute Resolution

- Provides a framework for raising and resolving disputes related to product delivery or agreement terms, enhancing the reliability and fairness of transactions.

### Dynamic Metadata Management

- Supports updating the metadata URI of registered products, allowing for the modification of product information while maintaining the integrity and history of the original registration.
