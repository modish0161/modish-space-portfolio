# Public Records Contract

## Overview

The "Public Records Contract" is a state-of-the-art blockchain solution developed to modernize public records management. It leverages Ethereum blockchain technology to offer secure, transparent, and immutable record-keeping with advanced features such as off-chain storage integration, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) verification for privacy, and automated data fetching using Chainlink oracles. This contract aims to serve governmental and public entities by ensuring data integrity, enhancing privacy, and improving operational efficiency in managing public records.

## Features

### Secure and Immutable Record Storage

- Records are stored on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring immutability and security. Each record's essential details, such as its IPFS hash and creation timestamp, are transparently recorded.

### Off-Chain Storage Integration

- The contract integrates with off-chain storage solutions like IPFS to store extensive data associated with public records, ensuring scalability and efficiency while maintaining blockchain's security benefits.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Implements RBAC to define specific roles within the contract, such as `GOVERNMENT_ROLE` for government officials and `ORACLE_ROLE` for Chainlink oracles, enhancing security and operational integrity.

### ZKP Verification (Planned)

- Plans to integrate ZKP verification to enable private and secure verification of records without revealing sensitive information, ensuring data privacy and security.

### External Data Fetching with Chainlink

- Utilizes Chainlink oracles to fetch external data securely, allowing the contract to verify record details against external databases or sources without compromising decentralization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ethereum wallet with ETH for transactions.
- Node.js and npm installed.
- Truffle or Hardhat for smart contract compilation and deployment.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

3. Compile the smart contract:

   ```shell
   truffle compile
   ```

   or

   ```shell
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

### Deployment

Deploy the contract to your desired Ethereum network:

```shell
truffle migrate --network <your_network>
```

or

```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <your_network>
```

## Usage

After deployment, interact with the contract to manage public records securely and efficiently:

- Use `addRecord` to add new public records.
- Utilize `verifyRecord` for record verification (integration with ZKP verification is planned).
- Employ `setDID` to link Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) with user accounts.
- Apply `storeRecordIPFSHash` to associate records with off-chain data.

## Security

The contract is designed with security as a priority, incorporating features like RBAC and planning for ZKP integrations. However, ensure thorough testing, auditing, and review before deploying to production to guarantee the contract's security and reliability.
